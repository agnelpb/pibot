<h2>Project Pibot </h2>



A project to control a Raspberry Pi bot with an Android app. It connects the server( the RPi ) and client ( the Android app ) through WiFi. We created WiFi hotspot in the Android phone and connected the RPi to the WiFi access point. You may also connect both to an external network for a wider range. You could fork the project and hack it to make really useful bots.


<h3>Client Side</h3>
Import the project to your IDE and have fun.

<h3>Server Side</h3>
You can optionally make your IP static and hardcode it the client Android app.
In the Raspberry Pi , you will require to install  Pi4j  to provide a bridge between the native libraries and Java for full access to the Raspberry Pi. In simple words, it allows you to control GPIO pins with Java.
